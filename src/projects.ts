      "A classic Battleship remake built with React and Tailwind CSS. It features a responsive grid, turn-based gameplay against a basic AI opponent, and smooth animations for hits, misses, and sunk ships. I focused on clean state management, accessibility-friendly controls, and mobile-first interactions to make it easy to play on any device.",

      "A lightweight weather dashboard that fetches real-time conditions and 7â€‘day forecasts using the OpenWeather API.

      "A simple but thoughtful todo app that supports nested subtasks, keyboard shortcuts, and local persistence. I experimented with optimistic UI updates, drag-and-drop reordering, and filter views (Today, Upcoming, Completed) to keep the experience fast and intuitive without needing a backend.",
